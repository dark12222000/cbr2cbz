## Requirements

You'll need to have an 'unrar' implementation installed and accessible. On OS X with brew this is as simple as `brew install unrar`. On most Linuxes, you'll want to install __unrar__ proper (sometimes called _unrar-notfree_), [not _unrar-free_](https://github.com/markokr/rarfile/issues/10).
